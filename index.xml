      <description>Do you support hate speech?
 We support all speech, because the line between discussion and hate is not easily defined. Don&amp;rsquo;t like a post? downvote, move on.    Where can I post content?
 wolfballs.com    Do you allow porn?
 We do not currently have a policy against it that may be revisited if it is a problem. We do not have much manpower to moderate that and it&amp;rsquo;s to easy for illegal content to be slipped in.</description>

      <description>We are a collection of individuals come together to facilitate the open discussion of what is cencored on the internet.
If there is anything that 2020 and 2021 taught us is that big tech is not fit to moderate information.
GOFS is a company dedicated to bringing open discussion of complex topics to the internet. To reawaken the spirit of freedom that once dominated the internet.
The answer to hate speech is more speech not cencorship.</description>
