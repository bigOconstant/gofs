      <description>Do you support hate speech?
 We support all speech, because the line between discussion and hate is not easily defined. Don&amp;rsquo;t like a post? downvote, move on.    Where can I post content?
 wolfballs.com    Do you allow porn?
 No, go to reddit if you want to be a degenerate. We don&amp;rsquo;t have time to moderate that. To easy for false flag CP attacks to get us taken down.</description>

      <description>We are a collection of individuals come together to facilitate the open discussion of what is cencored on the internet.
If there is anything that 2020 and 2021 taught us is that big tech is not fit to moderate information.
GOFS is a company dedicated to bringing open discussion of complex topics to the internet. To reawaken the spirit of freedom that once dominated the internet.
The answer to hate speech is more speech not cencorship.</description>
