<li>
<p>What kinda speech is allowed?</p>
<ul>
<li>All legal speech. We reserve the right to delete content that is obviously planted by governments, competing companies, bots, or ultra woke content. This isn&rsquo;t tumblr.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why did you start with lemmy? Aren&rsquo;t those guys commies?</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s not productive to build anything from scratch. We beleive in the ideals of federation, democratic development and the sharing of code. While we lean more liberarian here, populism is key to our collective freedom. We will fight our fight and respect their code liscenses.</li>
